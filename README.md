# Testing, QA, and Automation
Java code and JUnit tests written in CS-320

# Purpose
This code provides java classes that could be utilized for a scheduling or calender application.  All of these classes are fully tested by JUnit tests which have also been provided. 

# Lessons Learned
Throughout this project I learned to look at software requirements and, not only write code to meet them, but write JUnit tests that prove the requirements are met.  This automated testing means that any future development to the code can be immediately tested to ensure it does not break current functionality.  I also learned the theory of test-driven development.

# Future Development
These classes need a driver to put them to use.  They are well modularized, so the code can be reused.  I may use these in future projects where I require similar functionality.
